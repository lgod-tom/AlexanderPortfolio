              <p>Hi. I'm <strong>Tom</strong>, Thomas, or Tommy Alexander, depending on who you talk to they'll call me one of the three versions of my first name but typically I introduce myself as <strong>Tom</strong> these days.
I'm currently working as a freelance photojournalist. I have covered many different types of events ranging from professional and college sports to protests and full United States tours with a few different musical groups.
I also like to dabble in creative writing in my free time. I draw inspiration from classic novels and screenplays that I find interest in. My favorite author is Ernest Hemingway, my favorite book by him is <em>A Farewell to Arms</em>. </p>
            <blockquote>"The world breaks every one and afterward many are strong at the broken places." - Ernest Hemingway</blockquote>
            <p>Here's some other things I am quite fond of:
              <ol>
                <li>Video Games</li>
                <li>Wrestling</li>
                <li>Craft Beer</li>
              </ol>

          <p>I am currently working on a book called "Places I was Supposed to Forget." It is a collection of photos I take of different places that have certain significance in my life
             which are then accompanied by a story or just a few words that convey an emotional response. The "places" are scattered throughout Michigan as well as other parts of the country, however the theme is uniform for each place
             no matter how far apart they are on a map. Click through the image below to see a few samples.</p>
